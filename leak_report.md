# Leak report

Judging by the hints written in the MD file, I looked at the is_clean function and determined that the string (character array) cleaned does not free itself after its use, leading to unallocated memory sitting unfreed, reducing performance. Looking online, I found that the type (void*) is often used as a catch-all for typecasting pointers for freeing up memory, so I ran free((void*)cleaned) to clean up the memory leak in is_clean. 

I then ran valgrind on check_whitepspace_test, and used the hint of giving functions variable declarations and applied that logic to the strip() tests. More specifically, I declared a str variable that took in strip(s), with s being the desired string. Then, in the ASSERT_STREQ function, I replaced the direct call to the strip() function with str. I also found a source online stating that declaring a pointer to be null afterwards is good for preventing bugs within pointer variables (and Thatcher also told me it's a good idea), so I did that.

I then went back to the check_whitespace.c file, and fixed an error within lines 30-32 that caused a lack of a pointer by typecasting it to (char* const) and giving it a calloc() with one character (since it's just one char value) and the sizeof(char) because said char value is of the char type.
